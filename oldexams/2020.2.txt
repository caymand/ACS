7.1 Selection
7.1.1
In case of no index, we can do a linear scan through the table.
The I/O cost will be 25,000 since we have to consider each table

7.1.2
We can in worst case do an I/O pr. record in the index, since it is non-clustered.
Therefore we can risk 50,000 I/O actions.
Here it can be better to just do sequential scan.

7.2 Join and Aggregate
7.2.1
To do the join in 2 passes we have to use grace hash join
	sqrt(1,500) < 150
The I/O cost will then be 3*(25,000+1,500)=78,500 I/O
