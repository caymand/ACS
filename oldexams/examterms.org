+ Conflict equivalent
  Two schedules with same set of actions on the same transactions and
  every pair of conflicting actions are order the same way.
  So if there are two conflicts they should appear in the same order,
  c1, c2 in both schedules. The other cannot have conflict c2, c1.
+ Serializable schedule
+ Conflict serializable
  Conflict equivalent to some serial schedule.
  So if we take this schedule with conflicts, and a serial schedule
  then the conflicts are in the same order.
