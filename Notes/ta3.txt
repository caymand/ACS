-------------
1. Latency
Latency is the time to do an action.
Formally, it is the time measured between a change in the input system
and the measured change in the output system.

2. Throughput
Defined as 1/Latency
The rate at which a service can do useful work given a workload of requests

3. Latency and Throughput
For serial execution
	Throughput = 1 / Latency
For concurrent execution
	No direct link but we can look at the average when executing in parallel
	Throughput - sum of useful work done by each worker/machine
	Latency - latency for each worker / number of works

4. Concurrency effect on latency and throughput
