	Exercise 1
-------------

T1          R(X)          W(Y)
T2                 R(Y)            R(X)
T3  R(X)                                   W(X)

- Precedence graph
T1 -> T3
T2 -> T1
- Is it conflict serializable
Yes there is no cycle in the precedence graph
- Could it be generated by S2PL
No since T1 has a exclusive lock on Y when it does its W(Y) action
while T2 has a shared lock on Y.

	Exercise 2
-------------
T1  R(X)                 W(X)                       W(Z)
T2          R(X)                 R(Z) R(Y) W(Y)
T3                  R(X)

- Are the conflicts between {T1,T2},{T1,T3},{T2,T3}
	{T1, T2} -> No since T2 does not have a W(X) (There is in T2->T1)
	{T1, T3} -> No since T3 has no write actions
	{T2,T3} -> No since T3 as no write conflicts
- Is it conflict serializable
	For this we have to argue the it is conflict equivalent to some serial schedule.
	We have the conflicts
		T2, T1
		T3, T1
	So we can make the serial schedule
	T1                                      R(X)W(X) W(Z)
	T2          R(X)R(Z) R(Y) W(Y)
	T3  R(X)
	Which also only has the conflicts {T3, T1} and {T3, T1}
	So it is conflict equivalent to a serial schedule
- Could it be generated by S2PL
	No, sine  T1 gets exclusive lock on X while T2 has a shared lock on X

	Exercise 3
-------------
1.
A - Atomicity
C - Consistency
I - Isolation
D - Durability

Isolation is the form of atomicity we see from lock
	- Before or after atomicity
Durability is the form of atomicity from crashes and using recovery
	- All or nothing atomicity
	- The transaction must completely complete or not at all
Atomicity
	- Type of abstraction for strong modularity

2.
Yes S2PL has a lock acquisition phase but drops all locks at once
and therefore does not suffer from cascading aborts

3.
Yes S2PL can lead to deadlocks

	Exercise 4
-------------
1.
Yes conflicts are prevented, but performance is decreased since we are pessemistic

2.
Yes this is for instance the case with conservative two phase lock, C2PL

3.
Yes we do writes to local copies
